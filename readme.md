<h1>👁️ CivicEye - Public Grievance & Citizen Journalism Portal </h1>
<h3>Round 1 Submission</h3>

CivicEye is a modern, visual web platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and municipal authorities. It transforms the traditional, boring process of filing complaints into an engaging, community-driven "newspaper" experience.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">🚩 1. The Issue</p>
Why did we build this?

Opacity in Governance: Citizens often file complaints on government portals but never know the status of their request.

Outdated UI: Existing grievance portals are often text-heavy, clunky, and difficult to navigate on mobile devices.

Lack of Community: Reporting an issue feels like an indivisual task. Neighbors don't know if someone else has already reported the pothole on their street, leading to duplicate reports or no report at all.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">💡 2. The Solution </p>
"Instagram meets The Daily News" Simply means that the web portal is inspired from popular social media platforms and provides a similar engaging experience!

CivicEye reimagines civic engagement by combining the scrollable, visual appeal of social media with the authority and detail of a newspaper layout.

Visual-First Reporting: Every complaint focuses on photographic and videographic evidence.

Transparent Status Tracking: Clear badges (Pending, In Progress, Resolved) let users see impact immediately.

Community Validation: An "Upvote" system allows the community to highlight the most urgent issues, transforming the "Like" button to a functional "Support" metric.

Newspaper Layout: A clean, serif-font design that lends credibility and seriousness to the issues reported.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">⚙️ 3. Core Logic & Tech Stack (Round 1) </p>
For Round 1, we focused on building a Functional Frontend that demonstrates the complete user flow.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS(Custom Variables, Flexbox, Grid), JavaScript.

Icons: Google Material Symbols.

Key Technical Implementations:
We utilize three webpages each having it's own html file to demonstrate the engaging and visually apealing user interface.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">🚀 4. Features Delivered</p>
Interactive Home Feed: A scrollable list of complaints with a "Newspaper" aesthetic.

Smart Sidebar: Navigation with active state highlighting and a sticky account menu.

Publishing System: A drag-and-drop image upload interface with live preview and detailed form validation.

My Reports: A filtered history view showing only the logged-in user's submissions with status indicators.

<h1>🔮 Roadmap: Round 2 & Future Improvements</h1>
While the current version is not a fully interactive frontend demo, we plan to include the following implementations in the next round:

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Backend Integration:</p>

While for a proper database system, Technologies like MongoDB and PostgreSQL are much more safe and reliable options if we wish to publish this project on a large enterprise scale, But for simplicity we plan to use prebuilt techs like Supabase to create a permanent databse for the application.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Geospatial Integration:</p>

Replace the text-based location input with the Google Maps API or Mapbox to pin exact coordinates of issues.

Implement the "Live Map" view to see a heatmap of complaints in the city.
